DISK IMAGES ----------------------------------------------------------



RAW ---------------------------------------------------

Raw disk image format is default format in Qemu.

PROS of using RAW Disk Images:
    It is simple and portable to any other machine.
    It represents default binary format of a hard disk.
    Nearly raw performance then other formats, as it has very little overhead and no metadata and at last,
    Only data written will occupy space, rest of space will be filled with zeros, as it is a sparse file.

CONS of using RAW Disk Images:
    Does not have other features like compression, AES encryption and snapshot.
    Backup requires full disk-up, as no incremental back-upand at last
    Deleted files still occupy space and have to be removed.





CREATE
qemu-img create -f raw /var/lib/libvirt/images/minha_imagem.img 5G

PRE ALLOCATION SIZE
qemu-img create -f raw -o preallocation=full /var/lib/libvirt/images/minha_imagem.img 5G

VERIFY
qemu-img info /var/lib/libvirt/images/sample1.img



















QCAW2 ------------------------------------------------------

qcow2 is copy on write image disk, where constant size units called clusters compose a file. A cluster holds both data as well as image metadata.

PROS of using qcow2 Disk Images:
    Smaller images are produced, as no sparse file.
    It provides zlib based compression.
    For data security, AES encryption can be used to protect disk image.
    Multiple Virtual Machine snapshots are offered, as incremental back-up.
    Small Cluster Size improve image file size, and larger can be used for better performance and at last,
    Larger Preallocation increases performance as image size increases to grow.


CONS of using qcow2 Disk Images:
    Very slight performance loss in comparison to raw disk image, due to metadata, compression and encryption and,
    One needs to use fstrim to trim image file, as deleted files does increases image size.
